# To-do-list-with-checkboxes

All hard-coded, maybe change them into customizable blocks in the future.

It's intended for screens that has a 1980 x 1020 aspect ratio. Other resolutions will appear clunky (because the sizes are all hard-coded, not relative to display size).

I use Wallpaper Engine to set this as a interactive (I can check and uncheck the checkboxes on homescreen) background.

You can and should change the texts and the number of checkboxes as you desire.
